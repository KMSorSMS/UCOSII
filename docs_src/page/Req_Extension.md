# VS Code Extensions

With the above toolchain and ST Link, you will be able to build and flash program into STM32 with command line. But, there's no sane person will do that everytime. Using VS Code Extension will simplify your `build` - `flash` - `debug` process.

# Required Extension:

```
CMake
CMake Tools
Cortex-Debug
Memory View
RTOS Views
```

> Install with command: `` Ctrl + Shift + ` `` to open terminal, then paste (Shift + Ins) those commands.
> ```shell
> code --install-extension twxs.cmake
> code --install-extension ms-vscode.cmake-tools
> code --install-extension marus25.cortex-debug
> code --install-extension mcu-debug.debug-tracker-vscode
> code --install-extension mcu-debug.memory-view
> code --install-extension mcu-debug.rtos-views
> ```
