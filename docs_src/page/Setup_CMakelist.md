# CMake Basics

Every CMake-based application requires root `CMakeLists.txt` file *in the root directory*, that describes the project and provides input information for build system generation.

Essential things described in `CMakeLists.txt` file:

- Toolchain and compiler information
- Project name
- Source files to build with compiler, C, C++ or Assembly files
- List of include paths for compiler to find functions, defines, ... (`-I`)
- MCU sepecific compiler flags
- Linker script path
- Compilation defines, or sometimes called *preprocessor defines* (`-D`)

# Prepare CMakeList.txt file

This is the main CMake setup file.

- Make new file in project root: `CMakeList.txt`

- Modify `project name`, `linker file`, and `MCU sepecific setting`.

- If you are using this project folder structure, you may run the bash script `.\getIncludeList.sh` and `.\getSourceList.sh` to auto scan `/Application` folder for generating CMake source list.
  
- Otherwise, you will have to modify `/camke/IncludeList.cmake` and `/cmake/IncludeList.cmake`.
